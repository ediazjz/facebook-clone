# Description
What did you implemented/Why did you implemented this:
 - Explain the changes you’ve made.
 - It doesn’t need to be fancy and you don’t have to get to technical, yet.
 - Just explain what you have implemented at a high level.
 - Let the reviewer know the overall effect of the PR.
 - The “why” is a chance to explain both the engineering goal, but also some business objective that is satisfied or moved along.
 
 Examples:
 - What?: I've added support for authentication to implement Acceptance Criteria 2. It includes
  model, table, controller and test. For more background, see ticket #JIRA-123.
 - Why?: These changes complete the user login and account creation experience.
 
# Testing
Help me how can I test or look at the changes.
 
Example:
- I've added coverage for testing all new methods. I used Faker for a few random user emails and names.
